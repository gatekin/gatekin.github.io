### MY470 Computer Programming

### Week 7 Assignment, MT 2021

#### \*\*\* Due 12:00 noon on Monday, November 15 \*\*\*

---

The goal of this assignment is to practice using assertions, exceptions, and
writing unit tests in Python. The different problems will lead you through
a simplified routine for employing and evaluating binary classification
algorithms. We will develop our own module with evaluation metrics and
helping routines and then try it with the k-nearest neighbors classifier
from the scikit-learn package.
