The goal of this assignment is to practice writing and initializing classes in Python. The different problems will lead you through a simplified implementation of a simulation model for a contagion process on an empirical network. We expect you to work on the assignment with your assigned partner and to make full use of GitHub to facilitate the collaboration.
