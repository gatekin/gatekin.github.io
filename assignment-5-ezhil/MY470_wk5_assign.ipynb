    "### Simulating contagion on a network\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you are asked to write a program that simulates the contagion of disease or information on an empirical network. In academic research, contagion models have been used to study the properties of different types of networks. In practice, contagion models are extremely valuable to predict the spread of contagious disease such as the flu or STDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the simplest of contagion models — the SI model. SI stands for susceptible and infected. The SI model assumes that once a susceptible individual is infected, there is no recovery. This is a good representation for the spread of non-curable but non-deadly infectious disease such as Herpes simplex or for the spread of new technologies and knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the SI model we will implement, we will start with a population where everyone is susceptible. Then we will randomly pick a small number of individuals (\"Patients 0\") and infect them. In the next period, all the contacts of the infected individuals will get infected (thus, we will assume that the probability of transmission is 1). And so on. We will repeat the process until everyone in the network is infected or until a certain number of periods have passed (the latter is necessary for networks that are not connected and have separate components; in such situations, it is possible that the contagion never reaches some individuals). \n",
    "\n",
    "We will run the model on a real network. For simplicity, we will reuse the co-authorship network we analyzed in Assignment 3. So think about the contagion in this case as learning about a new research technique, empirical finding, or theoretical result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "Use docstrings to describe your methods. We will subtract points from your mark if you do not use appropriate description of your code.\n"
